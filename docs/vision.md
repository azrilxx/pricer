# NSC Pricer — Vision (Short)

NSC Pricer is an AI-assisted price agreement system for NSC Sinergi.

Long term, it should:
- Parse RFQs from email and portal.
- Match technical specs to a material master database.
- Calculate costs including material, logistics and mark-up.
- Handle dual-origin pricing (China vs Non-China) and client-specific rules.
- Generate price agreements with terms and conditions.
- Support approvals, audit trails and versioning.
- Learn from past deals to optimise margins and hit target profitability.

For v0, we only care about the basic data model and the core RFQ → Pricing → Agreement Draft flow.
